**About the paper:**  
In this work, we explored the regulatory networks controlling archaellation, the formation of archaeal motility structures, in *Pyrococcus furiosus*.  
We found that the transcriptional regulator EarA, together with intergenic terminator sequences, plays a central role in fine-tuning archaellum gene expression.  
I contributed by design the study concept, and analyzing regulatory elements influencing transcription termination.  
Our findings expand the understanding of post-transcriptional regulatory layers in Archaea and open up new avenues for studying archaeal gene regulation.
