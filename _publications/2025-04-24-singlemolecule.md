**About the book:**  
In this book, we provide a detailed yet accessible overview of single-molecule RNA sequencing technologies, including both Nanopore and PacBio platforms.  
We focus on practical considerations, experimental designs, biological applications, and the challenges encountered in applying these methods to research and medicine.  
It was an exciting opportunity to reflect on the rapid advances in RNA sequencing and distill this knowledge into an accessible format for students, researchers, and clinicians.
