**About the paper:**  
In this study, we investigated the role of MinD2 in controlling cell shape and motility in the model archaeon *Haloferax volcanii*.  
Our findings show that MinD2 has a unique regulatory influence on cytoskeletal organization and cellular dynamics, distinct from bacterial MinD homologs.  
I contributed by performing and analyzing RNA-seq, helping to understand the links between intracellular organization and environmental adaptability in archaea.  
This work expands our understanding of the functional diversity of MinD-family proteins beyond bacterial systems.
