**About the paper:**   
This study published in [Nucleic Acids Research](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/49/3/1662/6090297?login=false) is about the characterization of the universally conserved ribosomal RNA dimethyltransferase KsgA/Dim1 homolog in archaea. We contributed by performing statistical analysis and by constructing a knockout-strain.
