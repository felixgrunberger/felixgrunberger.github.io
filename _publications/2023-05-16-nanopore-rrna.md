**About the paper:**   
This study published in [RNA](https://rnajournal.cshlp.org/content/29/8/1255.long) is about Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) maturation in archaea, which is a complex multistep process that requires well-defined endo- and exoribonuclease activities to generate fully mature linear rRNAs.
