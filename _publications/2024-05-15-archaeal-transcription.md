**About the paper:**  
In this work, we investigated the archaeal RNA polymerase elongation complex using structural approaches.  
Our findings reveal the mechanisms of Spt4/5 binding and its impact on transcriptional regulation.  
It was exciting to visualize these processes at near-atomic resolution, which highlighted unexpected parallels between archaeal and eukaryotic transcription systems.  
I mainly contributed by analyzing the mass spectrometry data and helping to interpret the related findings.  
This study published in [Nucleic Acids Research](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/52/10/6017/7665651) deepens our understanding of fundamental transcriptional control mechanisms in archaea.
