**About the paper:**  
In this study, we explored the role of the archaeal Lsm protein in binding RNA targets during active transcription in *Pyrococcus furiosus*.  
Our findings show that Lsm preferentially associates with poly(U)-rich RNA sequences co-transcriptionally, suggesting a regulatory role in RNA stability and processing.  
I contributed by performing experimental validation of RNA-protein interactions and analyzing transcriptomic signatures linked to Lsm activity.  
It was particularly exciting to discover parallels between archaeal RNA regulation and eukaryotic RNA-binding protein behavior.  
This work broadens our understanding of RNA regulation mechanisms conserved across different domains of life.
