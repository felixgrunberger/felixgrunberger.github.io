**About the paper:**  
In this study, we investigated how a hyperthermophile dynamically responds to heat stress at both transcriptomic and proteomic levels.  
We identified early and late stress-response modules and uncovered regulatory networks that orchestrate adaptation to extreme temperature changes.  
I was responsible for RNA sequencing, transcriptome analysis, and cross-omics integration, helping to map the rapid molecular responses of cells.  
One of the most exciting aspects was linking transcriptional shifts directly to proteome remodeling strategies.  
This work provides a systems-level understanding of environmental stress adaptation in extremophiles and offers insights into thermal resilience mechanisms.
