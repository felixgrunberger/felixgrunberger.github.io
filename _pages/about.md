## About Me

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [German Archaea Centre, University of Regensburg](https://www.uni-regensburg.de/biologie-vorklinische-medizin/mikrobiologie/startseite/index.html).  
My research focuses on **transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes** in prokaryotes, with an emphasis on applying and developing **sequencing technologies** to study RNA biology in Archaea and Bacteria.

I am also passionate about **scientific data visualization** to translate complex biological processes into clear, impactful visuals.
